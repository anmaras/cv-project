# Cv-builder-project

The purpose of this project was to make a cv-application app that the user can create a cv while filling the forms and in the same time can observe how the cv application will look like.

## Build with

- React.js
- React-router
- Rect-icons
- ReactToPrint
- uuid

## Acknowledgement

The specific project idea was a assignment from the Odin Project curriculum.

## What i learned

This project was very fun to do and a learn a lot about

- Functional components.

- Project folder structuring

- Forms

- Controlled components

- React context API

- Custom hooks

- React Router

Also working with css modules and react was a breeze for me because i had a better organization and control over the style of each component and finally when i want to make a print of my final cv the react-to-print library was very useful.

## Future Improvements

- mobile support
